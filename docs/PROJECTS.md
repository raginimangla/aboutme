Below is a summary of some of my main projects that I have done over the years. This includes my experience as a technical writer and an instructional dsigner.

## **Technical Writing**

### **User Documentation**

As a technical writer in the Construction and Engineering (C&E) documentation team, I create and update user documentation for the new features that are developed and released each month.

**Project Link:** [Oracle Primavera Cloud Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/index.htm#t87921)

### **Administration Guides**

**Context:** I played a pivotal role in enhancing the Oracle Primavera Cloud administration guides. Primavera Cloud is a cloud-based enterprise application for construction project management. Upon joining, the application's administration guide was rudimentary. Given the centrality of application administration, my task was not only to document new features but also to improve existing content. I created quick-reference topics for the application administrators to define the configuration workflow and their tasks within the application. This helped reduce the administration related support tickets by at least 20%.

* [Tutorials]([https://raginimangla.github.io/ski-powder-alert-service/tutorials/manage-alerts])

### **Integration Documentation**

**Context:** Primavera Cloud integrates with Oracle and third-party applications using APIs, PIMS, plug-ins, or prebuilt connectors and recipes. I have been working on the integration documentation since the very beginning and have seen several changes to the integration strategy which required creating documentation from scratch. I write the integration documentation for the prebuilt adapters/connectors and recipes for the C&E suite of products. I also created documentation for the Zapier plug-in for Primavera Cloud.

**Project Links:**

* [Plug-in (Zapier Integration)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/integration/primavera_cloud_integration_using_zapier/index.htm#t248665)
* [Adapter/Connector Integration Guides](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/construction-engineering/smart-construction-platform/integration-documentation.html)
* [Recipes (Prebuilt integration workflows)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/construction-engineering/smart-construction-platform/integration-documentation.html)
* [Integration through Project Integration Management System (PIMS)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/integration/primavera_cloud_integration_overview/index.htm#t175519)

**Contributions**:

My contributions to the project include the following:

* Develop an integration guide for the Zapier plug-in to enable seamless synchronization between Primavera Cloud and third-party apps.
* Draft adapter and recipe integration guides enabling integration engineers to integrate their applications with Primavera Cloud using a low-code or no-code approach.
* Create PIMS integration guides to describe the process of integrating Primavera Cloud with Microsoft Project, P6 EPPM, and Primavera Gateway.

### **Help Documentation**

**Context:** Context-sensitive help documentation is available from a help panel inside the Primavera Cloud application.

* Execute concise and user-friendly content creation, adhering to a minimalist writing style. This approach aims to deliver information in a clear, accessible manner, enhancing user engagement and comprehension throughout the Help panel documentation.

### **High Compliance (FedRamp/IL4)**

**Context:** FedRamp stands for Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and defines the Impact Levels to categorize cloud systems based on the sensitivity of the data they handle. The specific requirements for FedRAMP IL4 are outlined in the FedRAMP Security Controls Baseline. These controls address various aspects of information security, such as access control, configuration management, and incident response. The goal is to ensure that cloud systems handling sensitive information meet the necessary security standards and can be authorized for use within the federal government.

* Integrate the narratives into the System Security Plan (SSP) and Authorization Packages (APs), which are furnished by and submitted to the FedRamp or other federally accredited agencies
* Prepare the SSPs and APs for audits by third-party agencies.

### **Analytics**

**Context:** The documentation team within the C&E division hosts its product documentation on Oracle Help Center. Utilizing Adobe Analytics, the team systematically gathers metrics related to documentation usage and popularity. These metrics play a pivotal role in shaping the content strategy of the team.

**Contribution:** I am responsible for the development and upkeep of documentation analytics reports for the C&E documentation libraries hosted on the Oracle Help Center. These metrics serve as instrumental tools for writers and documentation managers, offering valuable insights into the performance of the individual documents. The data derived from these reports plays a crucial role in informing strategic decisions related to documentation, allowing team leads to formulate effective strategies for their respective teams.

## **Instructional Design**

### **SAP/ERP Training Development Projects**

At the beginning of my career, I worked as an Instructional Design Consultant at Accenture and Deloitte. There, I accumulated extensive expertise in formulating training materials tailored for ERP implementations, mainly SAP. My deliverables encompassed a diverse range of learning resources, including eLearning modules, instructor-led training sessions, user guides, quick reference guides, and guided learning materials.
My proficiency in SAP extended across multiple modules, including Procurement-to-Payment (PP), Finance and Controlling (FICO), Accounts Payable (AP), and Materials Management (MM). This comprehensive understanding enabled me to contribute significantly to the successful deployment and adoption of SAP systems.
I have also worked with other ERP systems, notably PeopleSoft, thereby further broadening my spectrum of expertise within the realm of enterprise resource planning.

### **Non-ERP Training Development Projects**

I have also worked on the training development projects for several small-scale applications. For example, I contributed to the development of training materials for a software application portal known as ePharmaOne. This encompassed a suite of applications designed to enhance the efficiency of clinical trial site management. In addition to designing and delivering eLearning modules and instructor-led training (ILT) sessions, my responsibilities extended to the creation of video training content utilizing Camtasia.
