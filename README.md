I have over 10 years of technical writing and instructional design experience, I specialize in crafting clear and comprehensive documentation for SaaS applications. Proficient in both end-user and developer documentation, I leverage structured authoring and DITA concepts for consistency. Skilled in authoring tools like Oxygen XML Editor and version management using Git/GitHub. Experienced in agile environments, I collaborate closely with development teams to deliver high-quality documentation on time. My commitment to excellence and adaptability makes me a valuable asset in any technical writing role.
